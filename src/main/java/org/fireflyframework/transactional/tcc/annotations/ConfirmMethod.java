/**
 * Marks a method as the Confirm phase operation of a TCC participant.
 * <p>
 * The Confirm method is responsible for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Committing the reserved resources</li>
 *   <li>Finalizing the transaction</li>
 *   <li>Making changes permanent</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The Confirm method is called only if all participants' Try methods succeed.
 * <p>
 * The Confirm method must be:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Idempotent</b>: Can be called multiple times with the same result</li>
 *   <li><b>Non-blocking</b>: Returns a {@code Mono} for reactive execution</li>
 *   <li><b>Reliable</b>: Should not fail under normal circumstances</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @TccParticipant(id = "payment")
 * public class PaymentParticipant {
 *     
 *     @ConfirmMethod
 *     public Mono<Void> confirmPayment(
 *             @FromTry ReservationId reservationId,
 *             TccContext context) {
 *         // Commit the reserved payment
 *         return paymentService.commit(reservationId);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
