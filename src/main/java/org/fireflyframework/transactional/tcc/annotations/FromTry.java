/**
 * Injects the result from the Try phase into Confirm or Cancel method parameters.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is used in {@link ConfirmMethod} and {@link CancelMethod} to access
 * the result returned by the corresponding {@link TryMethod}.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @TccParticipant(id = "payment")
 * public class PaymentParticipant {
 *     
 *     @TryMethod
 *     public Mono<ReservationId> tryReserve(@Input PaymentRequest request) {
 *         return paymentService.reserve(request);
 *     }
 *     
 *     @ConfirmMethod
 *     public Mono<Void> confirm(@FromTry ReservationId reservationId) {
 *         // reservationId is injected from the try method result
 *         return paymentService.commit(reservationId);
 *     }
 *     
 *     @CancelMethod
 *     public Mono<Void> cancel(@FromTry ReservationId reservationId) {
 *         // reservationId is injected from the try method result
 *         return paymentService.release(reservationId);
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * If the Try method returns a complex object and you only need a specific field,
 * you can specify the field name:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @ConfirmMethod
 * public Mono<Void> confirm(@FromTry("reservationId") String id) {
 *     return paymentService.commit(id);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see TryMethod
 * @see ConfirmMethod
 * @see CancelMethod
