/**
 * Marks a Spring bean as a TCC (Try-Confirm-Cancel) transaction coordinator.
 * <p>
 * The TCC pattern is a distributed transaction pattern that provides strong consistency
 * through a two-phase commit protocol with resource reservation:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Try Phase</b>: Reserve resources and perform preliminary operations</li>
 *   <li><b>Confirm Phase</b>: Commit the reserved resources if all try operations succeed</li>
 *   <li><b>Cancel Phase</b>: Release reserved resources if any try operation fails</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Classes annotated with {@code @Tcc} are discovered by {@link org.fireflyframework.transactional.tcc.registry.TccRegistry}
 * at application startup. The TCC coordinator contains one or more participants, each defining
 * try, confirm, and cancel methods.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Component
 * @Tcc(name = "order-payment")
 * public class OrderPaymentTcc {
 *     
 *     @TccParticipant(id = "payment-service")
 *     public static class PaymentParticipant {
 *         
 *         @TryMethod
 *         public Mono<ReservationId> tryReservePayment(@Input PaymentRequest request) {
 *             return paymentService.reserve(request);
 *         }
 *         
 *         @ConfirmMethod
 *         public Mono<Void> confirmPayment(@FromTry ReservationId reservationId) {
 *             return paymentService.commit(reservationId);
 *         }
 *         
 *         @CancelMethod
 *         public Mono<Void> cancelPayment(@FromTry ReservationId reservationId) {
 *             return paymentService.release(reservationId);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
