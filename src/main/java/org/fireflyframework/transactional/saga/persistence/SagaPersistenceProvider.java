/**
 * Core abstraction for saga state persistence.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides the contract for persisting and recovering saga execution state.
 * Implementations can be in-memory (default, zero-persistence) or external storage like Redis.
 * <p>
 * Key responsibilities:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Persist saga execution state at checkpoints</li>
 *   <li>Recover in-flight sagas after application restarts</li>
 *   <li>Manage saga lifecycle and cleanup</li>
 *   <li>Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: All implementations must be thread-safe for concurrent access.
